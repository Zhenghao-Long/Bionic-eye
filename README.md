This folder demonstrats the CNN-LSTM model recognizing the existing of moving objects. It is based on a conventional camera and a motion sensitive bionic eye device.

The file named "CNN-LSTM model.ipynb" is a python code that can run in Jupyter Notebook 6.5.5.

The two folders "Conventional camera" and "Bionic eye" containing the scene reconstruction results of the two devices.

Additional non-standard hardware is not required.

To install Jupyter Notebook, please check https://jupyter.org/install. Typically it take less than 10 min to install.

To run the demonstration, please dowload all the files into a folder, then run the code in Jupyter Notebook environment. It showing that the CNN-LSTM mode can identify moving objects much easier based on the scene reconstruction result of the motion sensitive bionic eye. For a 5 epoch process, it typically take less than one hour to complete.

Training accuracy curve can be read out from the data plot after trainning.

Thank you for reading it.
